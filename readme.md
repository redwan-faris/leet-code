# LeetCode Progress in C++

This repository documents my journey through solving LeetCode problems using C++. Each problem's solution is demonstrated within a `main.cpp` file. Please note that not all solved problems are added to this repository yet. I plan to update it with more solutions progressively.

## Repository Structure

- `main.cpp`: The primary C++ file where I develop and test solutions for various LeetCode problems.

## Progress

This section tracks the number of problems I've tackled. The list will be updated regularly to reflect my latest work and will be supplemented with additional problems over time.

Note : there is some problems is missing I will add them later

- Total Problems Attempted: 86

## How to Use This Repository

- The `main.cpp` file contains the latest problem I am working on or have solved. You can check this file to see my solution approach in C++.

## Updating the Repository

Whenever I start working on a new problem or decide to add previously solved problems, I update the `main.cpp` with the new solutions. This way, the repository will gradually encompass more of my LeetCode journey.
